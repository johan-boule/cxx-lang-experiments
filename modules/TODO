*	Builtin rules: When we build in the source dir and we keep the ,
	make drops some circular dependencies, and proceed and fail to build object files with plain cc.
	make: Circular src/phrases/phrases.cppm.o <- src/phrases/phrases.cppm.ii dependency dropped.
	cc   src/phrases/phrases.cppm.o   -o src/phrases/phrases.cppm

*	Fail fast: When clang is not found, make will still try to build.

*	filter instead of findstring
